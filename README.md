# Using Bootstrap: Newsweek Clone

> Welcome to my Newsweek's clone, built html and Bootstrap, a CSS framework. Please enjoy and leave a comment. 
The purpose of this exercise is to show the capabilities of the Bootstrap framework and its advantages, such as web responsiveness out of the box.

By default, Bootstrap includes several breakpoints. The ones used here are:
Large (>=992px), Medium (>=768px) and Small (<768px).

The live demo can be found here:
